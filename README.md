# Number Guessing Game

## Description

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback to guide the player toward the correct number by telling them whether their guess is "higher" or "lower" than the secret number. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly.

## Features

- Player receives hints ("Higher" or "Lower") after each guess.
